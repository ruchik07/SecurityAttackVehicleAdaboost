The goal of this work is to contribute to ongoing cybersecurity research on electric vehicle charging stations by generating and publishing a dataset containing benign and attack scenarios. The attack scenarios include network and host attacks on the EV charger (Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment â€“ EVSE) in both idle and charging states. Network attacks consist of various Reconnaissance and Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, while host attacks include Backdoor and Cryptojacking. The main contributions of this research are: 
Creating and publishing a comprehensive dataset that comprises power consumption data, network traffic captures, and host activities of the EVSE under both benign and attack conditions.
Conducting statistical analysis on the datasets, evaluating specific features to determine their suitability for tasks such as behavioral profiling and anomaly detection. 
Assessing the suitability of the dataset for binary and multi-class classification of both benign and attack scenarios using machine learning algorithms. 
I'm using  "The CICEVSE2024 Dataset". 



#Adaboost Algorithm:-

AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) is an ensemble learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It combines multiple weak learners (often shallow decision trees) to create a strong learner. The algorithm works by assigning initial weights to each instance in the dataset, training a weak learner on the data, adjusting weights for misclassified instances, and iteratively combining weak learners into a strong learner based on their accuracies. AdaBoost is effective in handling imbalanced datasets and typically yields high accuracy. However, it can be sensitive to noisy data and outliers, and may be computationally expensive.
